### Hello there, I'm Arnav 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Toronto!
- 🤖 For my research I'm interested in understanding, utilizing and influencing cognitive processes such as reasoning and perception based on visualizations, stimuli, and software!
Currently I work on 3 main research topics: appearance-based gaze estimation, visualizing empathetic judgements, explaining explorable explanations. 

- 🥅 Some of my interests are as follows: Information Visualization, Human-Computer Interaction, Cognitive Science, Software Engineering, and Machine Learning too!
- 🌱 I’m learning new Visualization + Software Engineering techniques
