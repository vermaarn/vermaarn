### Hello there, I'm Arnav ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a lab manager at the Cognitive Tools Lab. I was a MSc Computer Science student at the University of Toronto!

In my research, I try to understanding human cognition through interactive graphics.

I also work as a software developer for Toronto Early Cognition Lab, also at UofT.
