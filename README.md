### Hello there, I'm Arnav 👋

I'm a MSc Computer Science student at the University of Toronto!
Currently I work on 3 main research topics: appearance-based gaze estimation, visualizing empathetic judgements, explaining explorable explanations. 

Through my research I hope integrate concepts in multiple domains to build interactive technologies. Through the aid of solutions from software engineering and machine learning, I try utilize principles in HCI & cogintive psychology to explore the design space visualizations and interactive tools. 

- 🤖 For my research I'm interested in understanding, utilizing and influencing cognitive processes such as reasoning and perception based on visualizations, stimuli, machine learning models, and software tools!
- 🥅 Some of my interests are as follows: Information Visualization, Human-Computer Interaction, Cognitive Science, Software Engineering, and Machine Learning too!
- 🌱 I’m learning new Visualization + Software Engineering techniques
