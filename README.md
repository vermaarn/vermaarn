### Hello there, I'm Arnav ðŸ‘‹

I'm a MSc Computer Science student at the University of Toronto at the Dynamic Graphics Project Lab!

Currently, I work on 3 main research projects: appearance-based gaze estimation, visualizing empathetic judgements, explaining explorable explanations. 

Through my research I hope integrate concepts in multiple domains to build interactive technologies. Through techinques from software engineering and machine learning, I try utilize principles in InfoVis, HCI & cognitive psychology to explore the design space of visualizations and interactive tools.
