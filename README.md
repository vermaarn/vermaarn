### Hello there, I'm Arnav ðŸ‘‹

I'm a MSc Computer Science student at the University of Toronto at the Dynamic Graphics Project Lab!

Currently, I work on 3 main research projects: 
- appearance-based gaze estimation 
- visualizing empathetic judgements 
- explaining explorable explanations 

In my research, I try to gain a deeper, and more formal understanding of cognitive processes in interactive visual design at the Dynamic Graphic Project lab at UofT.

I also work as a software developer for Toronto Early Cognition Lab.
